# TripCam Roadmap

This is a list of things I want to accomplish, in no particular order:

* Automatically reconnect the client when the server disconnects

* Support hot-loading configuration changes without restarting the server or dropping connections

* Support automatic layout and scaling of camera feed displays

* Put username labels on camera elements (so we know who we're lookin' at)

* Chat system (either integrate with some IRC client or roll my own)

* Load balance across cores - need that sweet sweet parallel goodness

* Private (password-protected) Rooms

* quad-tree based motion compression for video frames (or maybe javascript video encoding??????)

* Audio Support
  * https://subvisual.co/blog/posts/39-tutorial-html-audio-capture-streaming-to-node-js-no-browser-extensions/


* Look into supporting netcode.io
  * https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io
  * https://github.com/RedpointGames/netcode.io-browser
